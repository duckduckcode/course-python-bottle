# Add support for CSS and Images

When you're building a website using Python and Bottle, none of the files from the project can be accessed unless they have **routing** set up. That means that for any CSS, JavaScript or image files you need to set up a route in the same way as you would for a page.

These files are known as **static** files. Remember the difference between a **static** website vs a **dynamic** website, from the start of this tutorial?

> "In a static website, all the files are written using plain HTML and CSS and the website looks the same for every visitor. In a dynamic website, a program can display different things on the website depending on the data entered by the user."

Although we are building a **dynamic** website that can show different content for each user, our dynamic website contains some **static **content which is the same for every user. CSS, JavaScript and image files are not dynamic, they are static.

In a website built with Bottle it is recommended to put all these **static** files in one folder, and then create one route which will work for all static files.

To add a CSS file you will need to:

- Create a stylesheet
- Add the stylesheet to the HTML head
- Create a route for the stylesheet

##

## Create a stylesheet

In your project create a new folder called **static**.

In the **static** folder, create a new CSS file called **style.css**:

```css
body,
html {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  background-color: bisque;
}
```

This is a very basic stylesheet that changes the font to the default sans-serif font and adds a background colour. When the CSS has been set up correctly in Bottle you'll be able to see the background colour change.

Adding a CSS file to the project isn't enough - we also need to load the CSS from the HTML, and add a route using Bottle. You won't see the CSS affecting your page yet!

Checklist:

- Create a **static** folder in your project
- Create a new file in **static** called **style.css**
- Add some simple CSS to the file so you'll be able to see when it's working

## Add stylesheet to the &lt;head>

In the **index.html**, add the style.css file the same way you usually do for a website:

```html {diff}
<head>
  <title>Building Websites with Python and Bottle</title>
+  <link href="/static/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

If you try to load the website in the browser, the CSS will not work. If you open the developer tools, you'll see that there was a** 404 File not found** error for styles.css, which is the same error we had for the index page before a route was set up for it.

Checklist:

- Add a &lt;link> tag in **index.html** to load the CSS file
- Double check the CSS path is correctly set to **/static/style.css**
- Check the web browser dev tools to see the 404 error

##

## Create a route for the stylesheet

Every file in a Bottle website needs to have a route if it needs to be accessed from the web browser. For static files, Bottle has a special function for serving up the files in the correct format, since they can be any kind of file, not just HTML.

Import the **static_file** function from the Bottle library:

```python {diff}
from bottle import run, route, view, static_file
```

There are usually a lot of static files in a website. You'll definitely have a CSS file, maybe some JavaScript files, and there could be a whole lot of image files too. Instead of setting up a separate route for every single static file in the website, we can create one route which handles all of those files.

Add a route for the **static** folder in your **website.py**:

```python {diff}
@route('/static/<filepath:path>')
def load_static(filepath):
    return static_file(filepath, root='./static')
```

In the route, instead of using a specific file name, we are using a **pattern**. This route will be used for any file request that matches the pattern.

```python {diff}
@route('/static/<filepath:path>')
```

- The requested file path must start with **/static/**
- Everything after **/static/ **should be captured by the **&lt; > **brackets
- The bit after **/static**/ should be stored in a variable called **filepath**
- The variable **filepath** should be the special type **path** to support both files and folder

```python {diff}
  def load_static(filepath):
```

- Pass the **filepath** variable from the route into the function

```python {diff}
return static_file(filepath, root='./static')
```

- Look for files in the folder called **./static**
- Use the **filepath** variable to find a matching file in the folder
- Return the file as a Bottle **static_file**

These are all the steps you need to set up static file routing in Bottle. You might find that the CSS still doesn't show in the web browser - if so, do a **hard refresh** by holding **Shift** when you click refresh.

Checklist:

- Import **static_file**
- Create a route for all files in the **static** folder
- Check that the CSS is loading in the browser (you might need to hold **Shift** when you refresh)

## Clear the browser cache

Why do we sometimes need to do a **hard refresh** to see CSS changes in a web browser?

Web browsers usually save a copy of any CSS files they load so that they don't have to get it from the server every time a page is reloaded. Storing files like this is called **caching**. When a file has been stored in the cache, you need to do a **hard reload **of the website to make sure the browser loads the whole website and all its files from the server instead of from the browser cache.

To do a **hard reload** in Google Chrome, hold down the **Shift **key while you click the reload button.

You can see the difference between a normal reload and a hard reload by looking at the Bottle output in the command line. When using a normal reload, only the HTML will be requested from the server. When doing a hard reload both the HTML and CSS will be requested from the server.

Checklist:

- Try a normal refresh and a hard refresh in Google Chrome
- Read the server requests in the command line and spot the difference for a hard refresh
